<p>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong><br>
  To complete this project you will write and submit one HTML file containing embedded CSS (optional) and JavaScript (not optional). The file will be called lab1.html. This file contains a registration form, which can be styled any way you like subject to the requirements below.<br>
This single submission file lab1.html must be an ASCII file (i.e. a plain text document with a .html extension). You may create it with any editor but you must ensure that it is a text file. In other words, it should not contain anything except ASCII characters (including HTML tags/CSS rules/JavaScript and content).
